00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:03.02
- [Instructor] Info provides
a summary of the data frame

2
00:00:03.02 --> 00:00:06.05
including the number of
entries, the data type,

3
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:08.05
and the number of non-null entries

4
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:10.09
for each series in the data frame.

5
00:00:10.09 --> 00:00:12.08
This is important because
often when working

6
00:00:12.08 --> 00:00:16.03
with a real data set,
there will be missing data.

7
00:00:16.03 --> 00:00:18.03
You want a view of this to determine

8
00:00:18.03 --> 00:00:20.05
how you will handle this missing data.

9
00:00:20.05 --> 00:00:24.03
Let's head back to the Jupyter notebook.

10
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:28.03
So I enter the name of the data frame.

11
00:00:28.03 --> 00:00:29.05
We can see that we do not have

12
00:00:29.05 --> 00:00:31.03
any missing data in this data set.

13
00:00:31.03 --> 00:00:34.01
There are 29,216 entries,

14
00:00:34.01 --> 00:00:36.05
and none of them are non-null.

15
00:00:36.05 --> 00:00:39.02
What is also useful about the info method

16
00:00:39.02 --> 00:00:41.00
is that it also gives you the data types

17
00:00:41.00 --> 00:00:43.02
for the different series of columns.

18
00:00:43.02 --> 00:00:44.08
This is useful when you have to do

19
00:00:44.08 --> 00:00:46.08
any comparisons or queries.

20
00:00:46.08 --> 00:00:48.09
So for example, if you are
querying what is a string,

21
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:50.06
then you will know that
you have to use quotes,

22
00:00:50.06 --> 00:00:53.00
and if you are using a
comparison for an integer

23
00:00:53.00 --> 00:00:56.09
or a float value, then you
won't need to use those quotes.

24
00:00:56.09 --> 00:00:59.08
In the next video, we will
learn how to use Pandas

25
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:02.04
to do some basic data analysis.
