00:00:03.05 --> 00:00:04.09
- [Instructor] So, another
fun challenge video

2
00:00:04.09 --> 00:00:06.05
for indexing.

3
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:09.02
As usual, this should take
between five and 10 minutes,

4
00:00:09.02 --> 00:00:11.03
and I'll go through the solution with you,

5
00:00:11.03 --> 00:00:13.01
and this is just one of
the solutions available,

6
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:15.03
in the next video.

7
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:16.04
So, the first question.

8
00:00:16.04 --> 00:00:18.08
Plot the total number of
medals awarded at each

9
00:00:18.08 --> 00:00:22.01
of the Olympic games throughout history.

10
00:00:22.01 --> 00:00:25.01
And secondly, which
countries did not win a medal

11
00:00:25.01 --> 00:00:27.02
in the 2008 Olympics?

12
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:30.00
How many countries were there?

13
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:32.08
I'll see you next in the solution video.
