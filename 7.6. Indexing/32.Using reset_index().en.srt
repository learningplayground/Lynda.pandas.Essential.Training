00:00:00.02 --> 00:00:02.00
- [Narrator] Now, not surprisingly,

2
00:00:02.00 --> 00:00:06.04
the opposite of setting an
index is to reset the index.

3
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:09.01
And what we're doing here is
we're returning a DataFrame

4
00:00:09.01 --> 00:00:13.05
to its default, integer-based index.

5
00:00:13.05 --> 00:00:17.02
Let's head over to our Jupyter
notebook for an example.

6
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:20.02
Now we know that ath is a data frame

7
00:00:20.02 --> 00:00:22.03
that is indexed by athlete,

8
00:00:22.03 --> 00:00:24.07
because we did this in the previous video.

9
00:00:24.07 --> 00:00:28.06
So let's reset the ath data frame,

10
00:00:28.06 --> 00:00:32.00
so that it is indexed by the integers.

11
00:00:32.00 --> 00:00:36.07
So ath.reset_index,

12
00:00:36.07 --> 00:00:39.01
and SHIFT and TAB to look
at the options, and we see

13
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:40.04
that we run into the same problem

14
00:00:40.04 --> 00:00:44.01
that we did with set_index
where we need to specify

15
00:00:44.01 --> 00:00:46.03
that the inplace is true, if we want

16
00:00:46.03 --> 00:00:48.05
to do it to the ath data frame,

17
00:00:48.05 --> 00:00:51.08
or we can specify that
inplace equals false,

18
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:53.05
and then we need to set this data frame

19
00:00:53.05 --> 00:00:55.05
to another data frame.

20
00:00:55.05 --> 00:00:59.08
So let's say, inplace equals true.

21
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:04.05
And we do an ath.head and
here we expect the index

22
00:01:04.05 --> 00:01:09.09
to be back to the integer-based
indices for our data frame.

23
00:01:09.09 --> 00:01:13.00
In the real world, you can
often use the reset index,

24
00:01:13.00 --> 00:01:14.05
especially when you're trying to determine

25
00:01:14.05 --> 00:01:16.05
which is the best series to use

26
00:01:16.05 --> 00:01:19.05
as an index for your data frame.

27
00:01:19.05 --> 00:01:23.07
In the next video, we will
look at sorting an index.
