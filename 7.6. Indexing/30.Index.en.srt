00:00:00.08 --> 00:00:02.05
- [Instructor] Indexing.

2
00:00:02.05 --> 00:00:05.07
The index object is an immutable array,

3
00:00:05.07 --> 00:00:08.01
and indexing allows you to access

4
00:00:08.01 --> 00:00:11.06
a row or a column using a label.

5
00:00:11.06 --> 00:00:13.06
This is what makes Pandas special,

6
00:00:13.06 --> 00:00:16.01
because typically in other
programming languages,

7
00:00:16.01 --> 00:00:19.07
you cannot access an array using labels.

8
00:00:19.07 --> 00:00:22.02
Let's head over to the Jupyter notebook

9
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:24.07
to look at a couple of examples.

10
00:00:24.07 --> 00:00:28.03
So let's import Pandas's
PD and let's import

11
00:00:28.03 --> 00:00:34.08
our CSV dataset into our dataframe oo.

12
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:37.04
To try and understand a
little bit more about indexes,

13
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:40.06
let's look at their type, and you can see

14
00:00:40.06 --> 00:00:43.01
that an index has its own type

15
00:00:43.01 --> 00:00:46.08
and is not series or a dataframe.

16
00:00:46.08 --> 00:00:50.05
Let's look at the hundredth
element for this dataframe.

17
00:00:50.05 --> 00:00:56.02
So oo, index, and 100,

18
00:00:56.02 --> 00:00:57.04
and we can see that it's returned

19
00:00:57.04 --> 00:00:59.08
the number 100 because
that's the hundredth element

20
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:03.07
or the hundredth element
in that dataframe.

21
00:01:03.07 --> 00:01:05.09
Now indexes are immutable,

22
00:01:05.09 --> 00:01:08.03
so that means we cannot change them.

23
00:01:08.03 --> 00:01:12.06
So oo.index, and if I try and change 100

24
00:01:12.06 --> 00:01:17.05
to become, say, five, I get an error.

25
00:01:17.05 --> 00:01:22.06
I get an "Index does not support
mutable operations" error.

26
00:01:22.06 --> 00:01:25.08
In this video, we covered the
basic properties of the index,

27
00:01:25.08 --> 00:01:28.00
but there's a lot more to indexes.

28
00:01:28.00 --> 00:01:30.07
We will cover these in
the next couple of videos.
