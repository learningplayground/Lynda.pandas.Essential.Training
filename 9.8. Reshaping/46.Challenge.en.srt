00:00:03.09 --> 00:00:04.09
- [Instructor] I'm really looking forward

2
00:00:04.09 --> 00:00:06.06
to the challenges in this video.

3
00:00:06.06 --> 00:00:08.02
I've got a fun couple of questions,

4
00:00:08.02 --> 00:00:10.03
and this is a good opportunity

5
00:00:10.03 --> 00:00:13.08
to practice combining stack and unstack,

6
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:16.06
groupby, and plotting.

7
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:18.08
These should take you
between five and 10 minutes,

8
00:00:18.08 --> 00:00:21.01
so let's have a look at the questions.

9
00:00:21.01 --> 00:00:24.06
Plot the number of gold
medals won by the USA male

10
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:28.01
and female athletes throughout
the history of the Olympics.

11
00:00:28.01 --> 00:00:30.04
And finally, plot the five athletes

12
00:00:30.04 --> 00:00:32.02
who have won the most gold medals

13
00:00:32.02 --> 00:00:33.06
over the history of the Olympics.

14
00:00:33.06 --> 00:00:36.07
When there is a tie, consider
the number of silver medals

15
00:00:36.07 --> 00:00:38.08
and then bronze medals.

16
00:00:38.08 --> 00:00:41.06
In the next video, I will work through

17
00:00:41.06 --> 00:00:43.06
these solutions with you.
