00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.09
- [Instructor] Now, in
order for us to use pandas,

2
00:00:02.09 --> 00:00:05.09
we need to import Python's pandas library.

3
00:00:05.09 --> 00:00:07.08
There are two ways of doing this.

4
00:00:07.08 --> 00:00:09.05
We can type import pandas

5
00:00:09.05 --> 00:00:13.00
and what this is doing is
importing Python's pandas library.

6
00:00:13.00 --> 00:00:14.08
We're then in the position
to use the functions

7
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:16.06
available in this library.

8
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:18.00
And to use the functions,

9
00:00:18.00 --> 00:00:22.03
we will type pandas dot
and the function name.

10
00:00:22.03 --> 00:00:26.03
The other way to do is to
type import pandas as pd.

11
00:00:26.03 --> 00:00:30.01
Here we are also importing
the Python's pandas library,

12
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:32.05
but we're using the alias pd.

13
00:00:32.05 --> 00:00:35.02
This means that if you want
to access the functions

14
00:00:35.02 --> 00:00:36.06
and methods available,

15
00:00:36.06 --> 00:00:40.07
you only have to type pd
and the function name.

16
00:00:40.07 --> 00:00:43.09
Pandas documentation is readily available.

17
00:00:43.09 --> 00:00:46.08
All you need to do is
type a pd and the dot

18
00:00:46.08 --> 00:00:48.03
and then hit the Tab key

19
00:00:48.03 --> 00:00:50.05
and it will give you the options available

20
00:00:50.05 --> 00:00:52.08
within that method.

21
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:55.04
PD? provides the doc string

22
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:58.00
or a summary of an
object and how to use it.

23
00:00:58.00 --> 00:01:00.02
So, let's head over to
the Jupyter Notebook

24
00:01:00.02 --> 00:01:02.01
to look at how we import pandas

25
00:01:02.01 --> 00:01:05.02
and review the pandas documentation.

26
00:01:05.02 --> 00:01:09.07
So, we can import pandas
by typing import pandas

27
00:01:09.07 --> 00:01:13.04
and run that cell by
typing Shift and Enter.

28
00:01:13.04 --> 00:01:15.01
And then if you want to
access any of the methods

29
00:01:15.01 --> 00:01:18.03
so for example if we wanted
to know the versions of pandas

30
00:01:18.03 --> 00:01:21.08
so pandas.show_versions,

31
00:01:21.08 --> 00:01:24.05
this shows me not only
the version of pandas,

32
00:01:24.05 --> 00:01:29.01
but it shows me the versions
of the dependencies for pandas.

33
00:01:29.01 --> 00:01:30.04
I might want to shorten that

34
00:01:30.04 --> 00:01:32.01
to just get the version for pandas

35
00:01:32.01 --> 00:01:38.05
so I'll just type pandas two
underscores version underscore

36
00:01:38.05 --> 00:01:43.04
and you can see that I'm
using pandas version 0.20.1.

37
00:01:43.04 --> 00:01:45.07
Now, the other way to do
this is to use the alias

38
00:01:45.07 --> 00:01:51.09
so I do import pandas as pd, run that,

39
00:01:51.09 --> 00:01:56.09
and I can type pd version and run

40
00:01:56.09 --> 00:02:00.02
and I get exactly the same output.

41
00:02:00.02 --> 00:02:02.07
Now, on to pandas documentation.

42
00:02:02.07 --> 00:02:05.08
I can type pd and then
I just need to hit Tab

43
00:02:05.08 --> 00:02:07.07
and this gives me all
of the methods available

44
00:02:07.07 --> 00:02:09.04
within the pandas library.

45
00:02:09.04 --> 00:02:11.06
So, for example, when I used pd.show,

46
00:02:11.06 --> 00:02:13.05
I can hit Tab here

47
00:02:13.05 --> 00:02:17.04
and that will auto complete
that command for me.

48
00:02:17.04 --> 00:02:20.01
If I want to get more
information about a doc string,

49
00:02:20.01 --> 00:02:25.06
I can do a pd.show_versions
and a question mark

50
00:02:25.06 --> 00:02:28.00
and this gives me information
about that package.

51
00:02:28.00 --> 00:02:30.03
In this instance, there
isn't any doc string

52
00:02:30.03 --> 00:02:32.05
for show version.

53
00:02:32.05 --> 00:02:39.03
Let's try another method, pd.read_csv,

54
00:02:39.03 --> 00:02:41.05
and here you can see I get
the doc string for read csv

55
00:02:41.05 --> 00:02:46.00
which is read csv file into a dataframe.

56
00:02:46.00 --> 00:02:47.00
In the next video,

57
00:02:47.00 --> 00:02:49.04
we will look at series and dataframes

58
00:02:49.04 --> 00:02:51.07
which are the building blocks of pandas.
