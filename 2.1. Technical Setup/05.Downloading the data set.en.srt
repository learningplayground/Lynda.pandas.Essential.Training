00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:03.05
- [Instructor] In this video,
we will download our dataset

2
00:00:03.05 --> 00:00:06.08
and store it in a folder
for us to access and use.

3
00:00:06.08 --> 00:00:10.04
So let's get started by
downloading our dataset.

4
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:18.01
Do a search for Summer Olympic medal data.

5
00:00:18.01 --> 00:00:21.01
Let's select the first link.

6
00:00:21.01 --> 00:00:24.02
Select Get the data.

7
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:28.03
And select this link,
download the full spreadsheet.

8
00:00:28.03 --> 00:00:32.01
We can download the data
as a Google Document.

9
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:34.02
The first tab, Forms Response 2,

10
00:00:34.02 --> 00:00:36.04
doesn't seem to have
any information for us.

11
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:39.09
Neither does the second
tab, Form Responses 2.

12
00:00:39.09 --> 00:00:41.06
If you go to the third tab,

13
00:00:41.06 --> 00:00:45.06
we have a list of the medalists
at the Olympics per edition,

14
00:00:45.06 --> 00:00:50.00
sport, discipline, gender, and event.

15
00:00:50.00 --> 00:00:51.06
So the Breakdown shows the distribution

16
00:00:51.06 --> 00:00:55.08
of gold, silver, and
bronze over the years.

17
00:00:55.08 --> 00:01:00.03
The IOC Country Code helps
us to map the country codes

18
00:01:00.03 --> 00:01:05.02
that we saw in the medalists'
names with the Country tab.

19
00:01:05.02 --> 00:01:06.08
So the All Medalists tab seems

20
00:01:06.08 --> 00:01:09.01
to have the most useful
information for us,

21
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:15.05
so let's download this as a CSV document.

22
00:01:15.05 --> 00:01:17.01
The current name is a little long,

23
00:01:17.01 --> 00:01:22.03
so I'm going to rename
that to just olympics.

24
00:01:22.03 --> 00:01:28.00
And I'm going to store it
in a folder called data.

25
00:01:28.00 --> 00:01:30.08
We will be using this dataset
for the entire course,

26
00:01:30.08 --> 00:01:32.08
so make sure that you have it.

27
00:01:32.08 --> 00:01:35.01
In the next video, we will
have a quick introduction

28
00:01:35.01 --> 00:01:36.08
to Jupyter Notebooks.
