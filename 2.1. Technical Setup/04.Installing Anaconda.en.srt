00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:01.09
- [Instructor] In this video

2
00:00:01.09 --> 00:00:04.09
we will install Continuum's Anaconda.

3
00:00:04.09 --> 00:00:06.09
So, why Anaconda?

4
00:00:06.09 --> 00:00:09.03
Anaconda comes with a lot of packages

5
00:00:09.03 --> 00:00:11.04
that you need for data science.

6
00:00:11.04 --> 00:00:14.09
We will also use Conda, a package manager.

7
00:00:14.09 --> 00:00:17.07
Anaconda simplifies many of the challenges

8
00:00:17.07 --> 00:00:19.03
that a lot of people who are not

9
00:00:19.03 --> 00:00:22.05
full-time software
developers might run into.

10
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:23.09
These are things like installing

11
00:00:23.09 --> 00:00:27.05
different versions of Python,
not having correct privileges,

12
00:00:27.05 --> 00:00:30.00
or not having the required packages.

13
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:31.09
If you currently already have a version of

14
00:00:31.09 --> 00:00:33.07
pip or Conda installed,

15
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:36.03
then you don't need to
reinstall everything.

16
00:00:36.03 --> 00:00:38.07
Just check that you have the five packages

17
00:00:38.07 --> 00:00:41.04
that we'll be using for
the course installed.

18
00:00:41.04 --> 00:00:45.05
These are NumPy, pandas, matplotlib,

19
00:00:45.05 --> 00:00:47.09
Seaborn, and Jupyter.

20
00:00:47.09 --> 00:00:50.08
If you have pip, type pip
install and the package name,

21
00:00:50.08 --> 00:00:54.08
so for example pip install
pandas for the pandas package.

22
00:00:54.08 --> 00:00:58.06
If you have Conda, type Conda
install and the package name.

23
00:00:58.06 --> 00:01:02.09
So, Conda install matplotlib
for the matplotlib package.

24
00:01:02.09 --> 00:01:06.01
We will use Python 3.6.

25
00:01:06.01 --> 00:01:08.04
Let's say you already have
another version of Python,

26
00:01:08.04 --> 00:01:11.07
say 2.7, and you are already working

27
00:01:11.07 --> 00:01:13.04
with some other packages there.

28
00:01:13.04 --> 00:01:15.01
Then you might want to create a separate

29
00:01:15.01 --> 00:01:17.07
virtual environment for this course.

30
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:21.05
To complete a brand new
installation of Anaconda,

31
00:01:21.05 --> 00:01:28.04
head over to www.cotinuum.io/downloads.

32
00:01:28.04 --> 00:01:31.06
Click on the Windows icon

33
00:01:31.06 --> 00:01:35.08
and select Python 3.6 version 64-bit.

34
00:01:35.08 --> 00:01:40.03
We don't want to install anything else.

35
00:01:40.03 --> 00:01:47.00
Right, once we've downloaded
that, go to Show in Folder.

36
00:01:47.00 --> 00:01:50.02
Select Run,

37
00:01:50.02 --> 00:01:54.02
select Next,

38
00:01:54.02 --> 00:01:57.05
review the license
agreement, click I Agree,

39
00:01:57.05 --> 00:01:59.07
select Just Me.

40
00:01:59.07 --> 00:02:01.07
Make sure that this destination folder

41
00:02:01.07 --> 00:02:07.03
has no spaces in the destination path,

42
00:02:07.03 --> 00:02:10.09
and I'm going to add Anaconda
to my path environment variable,

43
00:02:10.09 --> 00:02:14.00
and select Install.

44
00:02:14.00 --> 00:02:17.04
Once this has been completed, select Next,

45
00:02:17.04 --> 00:02:20.01
and select Finish.

46
00:02:20.01 --> 00:02:23.07
So, type Anaconda,

47
00:02:23.07 --> 00:02:29.00
select the Anaconda Navigator here,

48
00:02:29.00 --> 00:02:32.01
and don't show again, so
select OK and don't show again,

49
00:02:32.01 --> 00:02:35.00
and you are now ready to go.

50
00:02:35.00 --> 00:02:38.00
If you've run into any
problems during installation,

51
00:02:38.00 --> 00:02:40.08
Continuum recommends temporarily disabling

52
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:43.06
your antivirus software
during installation,

53
00:02:43.06 --> 00:02:47.04
then re-enabling it after
the installation concludes.

54
00:02:47.04 --> 00:02:49.08
If you have installed for all users,

55
00:02:49.08 --> 00:02:54.00
uninstall Anaconda and
reinstall it for your user only,

56
00:02:54.00 --> 00:02:55.07
and try again.

57
00:02:55.07 --> 00:02:59.04
In the next video we will
download our data set.
