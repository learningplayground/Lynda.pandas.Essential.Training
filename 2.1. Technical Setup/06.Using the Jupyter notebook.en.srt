00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:01.05
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01.05 --> 00:00:03.03
we will get a better understanding

3
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:05.07
of using Jupyter notebooks.

4
00:00:05.07 --> 00:00:07.06
Jupyter notebooks allow you to create

5
00:00:07.06 --> 00:00:12.04
and share documents that have
live code, explanatory text,

6
00:00:12.04 --> 00:00:15.04
equations, and visualizations.

7
00:00:15.04 --> 00:00:17.02
There are two ways of doing this.

8
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:19.05
If you use Windows 10,
you can just look for

9
00:00:19.05 --> 00:00:22.06
the Anaconda Navigator,
and launch Jupyter notebook

10
00:00:22.06 --> 00:00:24.09
from there.

11
00:00:24.09 --> 00:00:27.08
Alternatively, you can
go to the command prompt

12
00:00:27.08 --> 00:00:32.07
by typing cmd, and then once
within the command prompt,

13
00:00:32.07 --> 00:00:39.00
type jupyter notebook and hit Enter,

14
00:00:39.00 --> 00:00:41.07
and this will retrieve
exactly the same thing.

15
00:00:41.07 --> 00:00:43.05
This will open the Jupyter
notebook application

16
00:00:43.05 --> 00:00:46.01
in the web browser on
the following address,

17
00:00:46.01 --> 00:00:52.04
http localhost, and you can
see you've got 8890/tree.

18
00:00:52.04 --> 00:00:55.02
The Files tab gives you
a list of all the files

19
00:00:55.02 --> 00:00:58.00
in your current folder or directory.

20
00:00:58.00 --> 00:01:01.06
The Running tab let's you
track your running processes

21
00:01:01.06 --> 00:01:04.04
and any open Jupyter notebooks,

22
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:08.07
and the Clusters tab is now
provided by iPython parallel,

23
00:01:08.07 --> 00:01:12.04
which is a Python package
and collection of CLI scripts

24
00:01:12.04 --> 00:01:15.09
for controlling clusters for Jupyter.

25
00:01:15.09 --> 00:01:22.02
To start a notebook, select
New under the File tab.

26
00:01:22.02 --> 00:01:25.05
Select Python 3.

27
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:30.02
You can see there the notebook
name, a menu bar, a toolbar,

28
00:01:30.02 --> 00:01:32.05
and an empty code cell.

29
00:01:32.05 --> 00:01:35.07
There are two modes that
we're interested in using.

30
00:01:35.07 --> 00:01:38.06
The first is to enter any text.

31
00:01:38.06 --> 00:01:42.00
We enter this in the Code cells.

32
00:01:42.00 --> 00:01:45.03
This is some text.

33
00:01:45.03 --> 00:01:49.00
This is done in Markdown
in Jupyter notebooks.

34
00:01:49.00 --> 00:01:51.07
The second mode allows
us to input and run code

35
00:01:51.07 --> 00:01:53.05
within our notebook.

36
00:01:53.05 --> 00:01:57.01
You can always select Markdown
or Code in the menu above

37
00:01:57.01 --> 00:01:59.08
after selecting a code cell

38
00:01:59.08 --> 00:02:02.06
by either using your
mouse or the up down arrow

39
00:02:02.06 --> 00:02:04.07
on your keyboard.

40
00:02:04.07 --> 00:02:08.07
Alternatively, you can
use keyboard shortcuts.

41
00:02:08.07 --> 00:02:12.05
For example, if I hit Esc + M,

42
00:02:12.05 --> 00:02:15.02
this means that the cell is now Markdown.

43
00:02:15.02 --> 00:02:19.08
Now to evaluate or run this
cell, I hit Shift + Enter,

44
00:02:19.08 --> 00:02:24.00
and you can see that I received
the text, this is some text.

45
00:02:24.00 --> 00:02:28.02
Hitting Esc + Y means that
the cell is now in Code mode.

46
00:02:28.02 --> 00:02:31.06
So for example if I type
32*32 and evaluate that

47
00:02:31.06 --> 00:02:37.03
by hitting Shift + Enter,
that evaluates that cell.

48
00:02:37.03 --> 00:02:40.00
There are only two other
commands that we need to learn.

49
00:02:40.00 --> 00:02:42.05
If you want to learn
anymore keyboard shortcuts,

50
00:02:42.05 --> 00:02:49.09
select Help, and Keyboard
shortcuts from the menu.

51
00:02:49.09 --> 00:02:54.07
So Esc + V will insert empty code cells

52
00:02:54.07 --> 00:03:00.00
below your current cell,
and Esc + A will insert

53
00:03:00.00 --> 00:03:04.04
empty code cells above your current cell.

54
00:03:04.04 --> 00:03:10.04
You can save this notebook
and give it a name.

55
00:03:10.04 --> 00:03:12.00
In practice, what you might want to do is

56
00:03:12.00 --> 00:03:14.08
share the notebook with other people.

57
00:03:14.08 --> 00:03:16.09
Now that you know how
to create a notebook,

58
00:03:16.09 --> 00:03:19.00
for the rest of this course
we will use the notebooks

59
00:03:19.00 --> 00:03:22.03
that I have shared and
made available to you.

60
00:03:22.03 --> 00:03:24.03
A tip for the real world.

61
00:03:24.03 --> 00:03:27.06
It is important that you
maintain these notebooks.

62
00:03:27.06 --> 00:03:30.00
These will be living
documents that you will share

63
00:03:30.00 --> 00:03:32.05
with your data science colleagues.

64
00:03:32.05 --> 00:03:34.03
You can build up a
portfolio that you can use

65
00:03:34.03 --> 00:03:37.08
as a living resume to share
with perspective employers.

66
00:03:37.08 --> 00:03:40.08
In many instances, if
you have used a notebook

67
00:03:40.08 --> 00:03:43.03
and documented assumptions and steps,

68
00:03:43.03 --> 00:03:45.09
if you come back to that
dataset at a later date,

69
00:03:45.09 --> 00:03:48.07
it can save you a lot of time.

70
00:03:48.07 --> 00:03:51.01
How useful your Jupyter
notebook will be to you

71
00:03:51.01 --> 00:03:56.00
will be determined by how
well you document your work.

72
00:03:56.00 --> 00:03:59.07
In the next video, we
will look at using Pandas.
