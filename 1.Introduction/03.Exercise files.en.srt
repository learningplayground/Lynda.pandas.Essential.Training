00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.02
- [Instructor] So I've
provided exercise files

2
00:00:02.02 --> 00:00:03.03
for this course.

3
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:06.00
I've currently stored this on my desktop,

4
00:00:06.00 --> 00:00:09.01
but you can store this wherever
you like on your computer.

5
00:00:09.01 --> 00:00:09.09
All you need to do

6
00:00:09.09 --> 00:00:12.06
is to be able to access
the relevant files.

7
00:00:12.06 --> 00:00:16.06
We'll have one Jupyter
Notebook per chapter.

8
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:20.03
So for example this is
the one for Chapter One.

9
00:00:20.03 --> 00:00:23.00
And I've also provided a
folder with our data set.

10
00:00:23.00 --> 00:00:25.06
And that's in the data folder.

11
00:00:25.06 --> 00:00:27.00
So feel free to download this

12
00:00:27.00 --> 00:00:29.03
so that you can follow along with me.

13
00:00:29.03 --> 00:00:32.03
In the next video we will
look at our technical set up.
