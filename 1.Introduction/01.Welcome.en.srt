00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.01
- [Jonathan] Welcome.

2
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:04.00
I'm Jonathan Fernandes
and I'm really excited

3
00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:07.07
about this course as it
includes two things I enjoy,

4
00:00:07.07 --> 00:00:10.08
Python's Pandas and the Olympics.

5
00:00:10.08 --> 00:00:13.08
So Pandas is an open source
library that provides

6
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:16.06
easy to use data analysis
tools for the Python

7
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:18.00
programming language.

8
00:00:18.00 --> 00:00:21.00
So the purpose of this
course is to be hands on

9
00:00:21.00 --> 00:00:22.09
and very practical.

10
00:00:22.09 --> 00:00:24.08
So each section builds the
knowledge that you would

11
00:00:24.08 --> 00:00:26.09
have picked up in earlier
parts of the course.

12
00:00:26.09 --> 00:00:29.05
So you learn how to
manipulate and query data

13
00:00:29.05 --> 00:00:31.06
more effectively and
the tools that you learn

14
00:00:31.06 --> 00:00:35.03
in this course will help you
become a better data scientist.

15
00:00:35.03 --> 00:00:38.00
So we'll cover topics such
as Series and DataFrames,

16
00:00:38.00 --> 00:00:39.06
plotting, indexing,

17
00:00:39.06 --> 00:00:42.01
Groupby, stack and unstack,

18
00:00:42.01 --> 00:00:45.00
and some data visualizations.

19
00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:47.04
Remember, if you want to get
the most out of this course,

20
00:00:47.04 --> 00:00:49.07
work through the challenge exercises.

21
00:00:49.07 --> 00:00:52.06
The data set we'll be
using are the medal winners

22
00:00:52.06 --> 00:00:56.03
for the Summer Olympics from 1896 to 2008,

23
00:00:56.03 --> 00:00:58.04
and I can't wait to get started.

24
00:00:58.04 --> 00:01:00.04
See you at the Olympics.
