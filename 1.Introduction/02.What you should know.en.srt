00:00:00.02 --> 00:00:03.00
- [Instructor] What you
should know about this course.

2
00:00:03.00 --> 00:00:06.01
So you can use Linux, Mac, or a PC.

3
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:08.05
I'm going to work on Windows,
but everything I demonstrate

4
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:11.04
will work the same on
other operating systems.

5
00:00:11.04 --> 00:00:15.09
We will be using Python 3.6
and the Anaconda distribution.

6
00:00:15.09 --> 00:00:17.09
If you already have
another version of pandas

7
00:00:17.09 --> 00:00:22.02
and another Python 3 version,
you're welcome to use that.

8
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:25.00
I've designed this course as
an intermediate level course,

9
00:00:25.00 --> 00:00:26.06
but don't worry if you're a beginner.

10
00:00:26.06 --> 00:00:28.07
I provide plenty of practice exercises

11
00:00:28.07 --> 00:00:31.03
and work through all the examples.
