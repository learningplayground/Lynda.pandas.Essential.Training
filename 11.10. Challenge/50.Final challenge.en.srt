(contemplative synth music)

2
00:00:03.06 --> 00:00:05.01
- [Instructor] So on to our final

3
00:00:05.01 --> 00:00:07.09
challenge video for this course.

4
00:00:07.09 --> 00:00:10.01
It uses most of the concepts
that we have learned

5
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:13.07
in this course, and this
is a really fun question,

6
00:00:13.07 --> 00:00:16.06
and there are a couple of
ways to go about solving it.

7
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:19.04
This should take you
between five to 10 minutes,

8
00:00:19.04 --> 00:00:21.03
and as usual, we will work through

9
00:00:21.03 --> 00:00:24.02
the solution together in the next video.

10
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:27.02
In every Olympics, which US athlete

11
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:29.09
has won the most total number of medals?

12
00:00:29.09 --> 00:00:34.00
Include the athlete's
discipline in your solution
