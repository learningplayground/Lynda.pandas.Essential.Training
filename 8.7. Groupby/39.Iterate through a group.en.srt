1
00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:02.08
- [Narrator] We can
iterate through groups.

2
00:00:02.08 --> 00:00:04.02
As we mentioned earlier,

3
00:00:04.02 --> 00:00:06.03
each of these groups are data frames.

4
00:00:06.03 --> 00:00:09.03
What we can do here,
is to print out the key

5
00:00:09.03 --> 00:00:11.09
and then print out the rows
corresponding to that key.

6
00:00:11.09 --> 00:00:15.03
As an example, on the olympics
dataset we are working on,

7
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:17.04
if we group by each olympic here,

8
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:20.02
then the key would be the
olympic edition or year,

9
00:00:20.02 --> 00:00:21.03
and the group portion would be

10
00:00:21.03 --> 00:00:24.03
all of the rows corresponding
to that edition.

11
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:26.06
Then Groupby prints the
next olympic edition,

12
00:00:26.06 --> 00:00:29.08
followed by all of the rows
corresponding to that edition.

13
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:33.00
Let's take a look in our Jupyter notebook.

14
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:34.07
So what we want to do here is to look

15
00:00:34.07 --> 00:00:36.09
through the Groupby object,

16
00:00:36.09 --> 00:00:41.07
for group key

17
00:00:41.07 --> 00:00:46.02
group value in,

18
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:49.08
and then a Groupby object

19
00:00:49.08 --> 00:00:54.00
which is Edition in this case,
we are grouping by edition.

20
00:00:54.00 --> 00:00:56.05
This is just a very simple Python script.

21
00:00:56.05 --> 00:01:00.08
I want to print the group key

22
00:01:00.08 --> 00:01:05.07
and I want to print the group value.

23
00:01:05.07 --> 00:01:10.03
And I change that to value,

24
00:01:10.03 --> 00:01:12.07
and the group value

25
00:01:12.07 --> 00:01:15.09
and let's run this.

26
00:01:15.09 --> 00:01:17.00
And basically what we see here

27
00:01:17.00 --> 00:01:19.07
is what we saw in the
list command earlier,

28
00:01:19.07 --> 00:01:22.09
so this is the key, which is the edition,

29
00:01:22.09 --> 00:01:24.07
or the year of that olympics, and then

30
00:01:24.07 --> 00:01:26.07
all of the rows
corresponding to that year,

31
00:01:26.07 --> 00:01:29.01
the next one will be for the 1900,

32
00:01:29.01 --> 00:01:32.06
and all of the rows
corresponding to that year.

33
00:01:32.06 --> 00:01:37.00
So let's confirm what type
each of these groups are.

34
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:39.09
So the rows corresponding to each year.

35
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:44.02
So remember, that type has
the variable group value

36
00:01:44.02 --> 00:01:48.06
so I type group value

37
00:01:48.06 --> 00:01:53.01
and not surprisingly,
this is a data frame.

38
00:01:53.01 --> 00:01:56.07
In the next video, we will
look at Groupby computations.
