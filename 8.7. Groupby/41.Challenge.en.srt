00:00:03.08 --> 00:00:05.02
- [Instructor] So here are a fun couple

2
00:00:05.02 --> 00:00:06.07
of groupby questions.

3
00:00:06.07 --> 00:00:08.09
These should take you
between five and ten minutes

4
00:00:08.09 --> 00:00:11.08
and remember, as usual,
I'll go through the solution

5
00:00:11.08 --> 00:00:13.08
with you in the next video.

6
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:16.05
So let's take a look at the questions.

7
00:00:16.05 --> 00:00:19.05
Using groupby, plot the total
number of medals awarded

8
00:00:19.05 --> 00:00:22.09
at each of the Olympic
games throughout history

9
00:00:22.09 --> 00:00:26.00
and next, create a list
showing the total number

10
00:00:26.00 --> 00:00:29.05
of medals won for each
country over the history of

11
00:00:29.05 --> 00:00:30.07
the Olympics.

12
00:00:30.07 --> 00:00:32.08
For each country, include
the year of the first

13
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:35.02
and the most recent Olympic medal wins.

14
00:00:35.02 --> 00:00:38.00
I'll see you at the solution video.
