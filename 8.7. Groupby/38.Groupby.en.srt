00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:01.04
- [Instructor] Groupby is one

2
00:00:01.04 --> 00:00:05.05
of the most important
functionalities available in Pandas.

3
00:00:05.05 --> 00:00:07.04
Groupby does three things.

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:09.01
It splits a DataFrame into groups

5
00:00:09.01 --> 00:00:10.09
based on some criteria,

6
00:00:10.09 --> 00:00:13.06
it applies a function to
each group independently

7
00:00:13.06 --> 00:00:17.01
and it combines the
results into a DataFrame.

8
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:18.08
Now, many people when they first learn

9
00:00:18.08 --> 00:00:20.03
how to use the Groupby function,

10
00:00:20.03 --> 00:00:22.08
don't know what to do
with the Groupby object.

11
00:00:22.08 --> 00:00:25.00
Creating the Groupby object only verifies

12
00:00:25.00 --> 00:00:27.09
that you've passed a valid mapping.

13
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:29.07
The Groupby object isn't a DataFrame

14
00:00:29.07 --> 00:00:31.05
but rather a group of DataFrames

15
00:00:31.05 --> 00:00:33.06
in a dict-like structure.

16
00:00:33.06 --> 00:00:36.06
On the next slide, we have
a useful visualization

17
00:00:36.06 --> 00:00:41.03
that helps us show what
the Groupby function does.

18
00:00:41.03 --> 00:00:43.09
So, Groupby splits the
DataFrame into groups.

19
00:00:43.09 --> 00:00:46.05
Each of these groups
remember is a DataFrame,

20
00:00:46.05 --> 00:00:49.01
it applies a function for each group

21
00:00:49.01 --> 00:00:50.02
and then finally it combines

22
00:00:50.02 --> 00:00:52.05
the results into a DataFrame.

23
00:00:52.05 --> 00:00:54.02
Let's head over to the Jupyter Notebook

24
00:00:54.02 --> 00:00:57.01
to look at a couple of examples.

25
00:00:57.01 --> 00:01:00.02
So, let's import Pandas as PD.

26
00:01:00.02 --> 00:01:04.04
We read the Olympic CSV file
into our DataFrame called 00

27
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:06.00
and now let's Groupby by the edition,

28
00:01:06.00 --> 00:01:08.08
so we use the DataFrame 00,

29
00:01:08.08 --> 00:01:13.05
Groupby and we're grouping by edition

30
00:01:13.05 --> 00:01:17.09
and as you can see this
returns a Groupby object.

31
00:01:17.09 --> 00:01:22.00
Now, let's determine what
type this Groupby object is,

32
00:01:22.00 --> 00:01:25.03
so I'm just going to copy this

33
00:01:25.03 --> 00:01:29.01
and I say type

34
00:01:29.01 --> 00:01:31.08
and we can see that the Groupby object

35
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:35.00
is of type DataFrameGroupby.

36
00:01:35.00 --> 00:01:36.06
Now you can actually put this into a list

37
00:01:36.06 --> 00:01:38.03
to see how the things are grouped

38
00:01:38.03 --> 00:01:39.06
when grouping by objects,

39
00:01:39.06 --> 00:01:46.05
so let's use the list command

40
00:01:46.05 --> 00:01:48.00
and we can see that the Groupby object

41
00:01:48.00 --> 00:01:51.00
is first the edition

42
00:01:51.00 --> 00:01:53.07
and then all of the rows
corresponding to that edition

43
00:01:53.07 --> 00:01:55.04
and then if we scroll further down,

44
00:01:55.04 --> 00:02:01.01
we'll find that it's the next year,

45
00:02:01.01 --> 00:02:06.00
1900 and then all of the
rows corresponding to 1900.

46
00:02:06.00 --> 00:02:08.02
In the next video we
will look at iterating

47
00:02:08.02 --> 00:02:09.05
through a group.
