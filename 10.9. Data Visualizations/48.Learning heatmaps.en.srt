00:00:00.08 --> 00:00:03.05
- [Instructor] Data Visualizations.

2
00:00:03.05 --> 00:00:04.07
Using the Olympic data set

3
00:00:04.07 --> 00:00:06.08
we have used so far in this course,

4
00:00:06.08 --> 00:00:09.01
let's say you wanted to present a summary

5
00:00:09.01 --> 00:00:12.03
of the total medals won
by participating countries

6
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:16.05
in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

7
00:00:16.05 --> 00:00:21.00
Which of these two do you find
more intuitive and readable?

8
00:00:21.00 --> 00:00:22.04
I hope you'll agree with me

9
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:26.06
that the heatmap is far
more intuitive and helpful.

10
00:00:26.06 --> 00:00:28.07
Let's look to see how we can create these

11
00:00:28.07 --> 00:00:31.06
in our Jupiter Notebook.

12
00:00:31.06 --> 00:00:33.09
Because we're going to be using Seaborn,

13
00:00:33.09 --> 00:00:38.05
let's import Seaborn

14
00:00:38.05 --> 00:00:48.05
as sns.

15
00:00:48.05 --> 00:00:50.05
What we want here are all the medals

16
00:00:50.05 --> 00:00:53.03
won in the 2008 Olympics.

17
00:00:53.03 --> 00:00:56.00
So, oo.Edition

18
00:00:56.00 --> 00:00:59.07
equals 2008.

19
00:00:59.07 --> 00:01:10.08
Let's store that in the
data frame Last Olympics.

20
00:01:10.08 --> 00:01:14.00
Now we have in our data frame LO,

21
00:01:14.00 --> 00:01:16.04
all of the medals won by the athletes

22
00:01:16.04 --> 00:01:20.00
in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

23
00:01:20.00 --> 00:01:26.01
I want to group by the
countries, which is the NOC,

24
00:01:26.01 --> 00:01:28.08
and the medals won.

25
00:01:28.08 --> 00:01:32.04
I do a size off of that.

26
00:01:32.04 --> 00:01:35.05
We can see that we've
got a group by object

27
00:01:35.05 --> 00:01:37.05
sorted alphabetically by
the different countries

28
00:01:37.05 --> 00:01:39.05
and the medals won.

29
00:01:39.05 --> 00:01:43.02
Let's unstack this

30
00:01:43.02 --> 00:01:44.03
with medal,

31
00:01:44.03 --> 00:01:48.03
and we'll fill value

32
00:01:48.03 --> 00:01:49.04
with zero.

33
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:54.00
Let's look at the result of that.

34
00:01:54.00 --> 00:01:57.02
We've got a couple of
challenges with our data frame.

35
00:01:57.02 --> 00:01:59.05
Firstly, it doesn't seem to be sorted

36
00:01:59.05 --> 00:02:02.03
in order of the number of medals.

37
00:02:02.03 --> 00:02:04.07
Secondly, we've got the column headings

38
00:02:04.07 --> 00:02:06.03
as bronze, gold, and silver.

39
00:02:06.03 --> 00:02:07.09
So let's modify that.

40
00:02:07.09 --> 00:02:13.00
I'm going to call this group by object g,

41
00:02:13.00 --> 00:02:18.01
and I'm going to sort values by

42
00:02:18.01 --> 00:02:20.04
gold,

43
00:02:20.04 --> 00:02:23.01
silver,

44
00:02:23.01 --> 00:02:25.08
and bronze;

45
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:27.02
which is a list.

46
00:02:27.02 --> 00:02:33.00
Let's include that as a list
of gold, silver, and bronze.

47
00:02:33.00 --> 00:02:39.03
Remember that we want
this in descending order.

48
00:02:39.03 --> 00:02:41.03
I then view that.

49
00:02:41.03 --> 00:02:46.01
I've got the medals in descending
order for the countries.

50
00:02:46.01 --> 00:02:48.03
The only challenge I still have
is that the column headings

51
00:02:48.03 --> 00:02:50.04
are still bronze, gold, and silver.

52
00:02:50.04 --> 00:02:56.00
We can easily modify that
by saying we want that

53
00:02:56.00 --> 00:03:03.05
in the sequence gold, silver, bronze.

54
00:03:03.05 --> 00:03:11.07
Let's store that in the data frame g.

55
00:03:11.07 --> 00:03:14.06
So we have the table that
we want with the countries

56
00:03:14.06 --> 00:03:18.06
sorted by the number of gold,
silver, and bronze medals

57
00:03:18.06 --> 00:03:23.01
that they won in the 2008 Olympics.

58
00:03:23.01 --> 00:03:27.00
Let's plot this using a heat map.

59
00:03:27.00 --> 00:03:29.08
Sns for Seaborn,

60
00:03:29.08 --> 00:03:31.06
heatmap,

61
00:03:31.06 --> 00:03:36.02
and as input we provide the data frame.

62
00:03:36.02 --> 00:03:39.01
We've got a couple of
challenges with this figure.

63
00:03:39.01 --> 00:03:43.04
Firstly, the gold, silver and
bronze is across the x axes,

64
00:03:43.04 --> 00:03:47.00
with the countries along the y axes.

65
00:03:47.00 --> 00:03:48.06
If we swap those around,

66
00:03:48.06 --> 00:03:51.01
then perhaps the country
names will be more readable.

67
00:03:51.01 --> 00:03:54.04
Secondly, we need to
increase this figure size.

68
00:03:54.04 --> 00:04:03.01
Let's do a transpose of the data frame.

69
00:04:03.01 --> 00:04:04.04
Let's have a look at the data frame.

70
00:04:04.04 --> 00:04:07.02
Now we have the different countries

71
00:04:07.02 --> 00:04:10.06
as columns across the top,
and we've got each row

72
00:04:10.06 --> 00:04:11.07
corresponding to the number

73
00:04:11.07 --> 00:04:14.03
of gold, silver, and bronze medals.

74
00:04:14.03 --> 00:04:16.00
We seem to be in a better position now,

75
00:04:16.00 --> 00:04:18.08
so let's change the figure size.

76
00:04:18.08 --> 00:04:24.05
Plot figure,

77
00:04:24.05 --> 00:04:26.00
figure size.

78
00:04:26.00 --> 00:04:33.00
Let's make this 16 inches by five inches.

79
00:04:33.00 --> 00:04:39.00
We've got the heatmap g.

80
00:04:39.00 --> 00:04:43.01
Here you see we've got the
gold, silver, and bronze medals

81
00:04:43.01 --> 00:04:44.09
across the y axes,

82
00:04:44.09 --> 00:04:48.01
and we've got the different
countries across the x axes.

83
00:04:48.01 --> 00:04:50.09
This makes for very intuitive reading.

84
00:04:50.09 --> 00:04:51.09
There are a couple of insights

85
00:04:51.09 --> 00:04:54.04
that we can gain from this straight away.

86
00:04:54.04 --> 00:04:57.01
We can see that the
USA has a higher number

87
00:04:57.01 --> 00:05:02.00
of gold and silver versus bronze medals.

88
00:05:02.00 --> 00:05:03.02
We can see that China

89
00:05:03.02 --> 00:05:06.01
has a higher proportion of gold medals.

90
00:05:06.01 --> 00:05:07.03
Australia has significantly

91
00:05:07.03 --> 00:05:11.01
more bronze than gold or silver medals.

92
00:05:11.01 --> 00:05:15.07
Similarly, we can see
that both Spain and Cuba

93
00:05:15.07 --> 00:05:17.01
have the highest proportion of medals

94
00:05:17.01 --> 00:05:19.07
in the silver category.

95
00:05:19.07 --> 00:05:22.03
There seems to have been a
very closely fought battle

96
00:05:22.03 --> 00:05:27.05
for the third position with
Russia, Germany, South Korea,

97
00:05:27.05 --> 00:05:29.08
and The Netherlands.

98
00:05:29.08 --> 00:05:31.09
As you can see, the Seaborn heatmaps

99
00:05:31.09 --> 00:05:35.03
provide some very intuitive plots.

100
00:05:35.03 --> 00:05:38.05
Next, we will look at
creating our own color maps.
