00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.06
- [Narrator] A dataframe is
like a two dimensional area.

2
00:00:03.06 --> 00:00:06.05
You can think of a dataframe
as being like a table or a

3
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:09.05
spreadsheet with rows and columns.

4
00:00:09.05 --> 00:00:12.03
You can see from our Olympics
data set that the dataframe

5
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:15.02
is made up of several
columns such as the city,

6
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:17.02
the addition, and sport.

7
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:19.03
And each entry, or row,

8
00:00:19.03 --> 00:00:22.04
corresponds to a medal
that an athlete has won.

9
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:25.00
This is all there is to a dataframe.

10
00:00:25.00 --> 00:00:27.04
Let's head over to the Jupiter notebook

11
00:00:27.04 --> 00:00:31.08
to understand a little
bit more about dataframes.

12
00:00:31.08 --> 00:00:34.01
The first thing we'll need
to do in our notebook,

13
00:00:34.01 --> 00:00:37.04
is to import pandas.

14
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:40.00
Inport pandas as pd.

15
00:00:40.00 --> 00:00:43.00
Now we will make more sense
of these next few lines in the

16
00:00:43.00 --> 00:00:45.08
read csv video, so don't
worry to much about them.

17
00:00:45.08 --> 00:00:48.03
Basically what we are doing here is

18
00:00:48.03 --> 00:00:52.02
we are reading the csv file
into a dataframe called oo,

19
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:54.04
so let's run that.

20
00:00:54.04 --> 00:00:56.08
In order to view the dataframe,

21
00:00:56.08 --> 00:00:59.04
we enter the dataframes name which is oo

22
00:00:59.04 --> 00:01:01.05
and run that cell.

23
00:01:01.05 --> 00:01:05.08
The Jupiter notebook will
display the first 30 rows

24
00:01:05.08 --> 00:01:09.01
and the last 30 rows.

25
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:11.04
And we can see that in this dataframe,

26
00:01:11.04 --> 00:01:15.03
we have 29,216 rows.

27
00:01:15.03 --> 00:01:19.03
In the next video, we will
look at panda's series.
