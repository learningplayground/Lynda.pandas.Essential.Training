00:00:03.08 --> 00:00:05.01
- [Instructor] So let's get started

2
00:00:05.01 --> 00:00:06.08
with our first challenge questions.

3
00:00:06.08 --> 00:00:08.09
This should be fairly easy,
so it should take you less

4
00:00:08.09 --> 00:00:11.03
than five minutes.

5
00:00:11.03 --> 00:00:14.03
The first one is list
our Olympics DataFrame,

6
00:00:14.03 --> 00:00:17.09
list only the NOC column,
that's the countries

7
00:00:17.09 --> 00:00:21.04
the athletes represent using
both the square bracket

8
00:00:21.04 --> 00:00:24.03
notation and the dot notation.

9
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:27.02
What type is this object?

10
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:30.07
And finally, list the edition,
the city, the athlete's name

11
00:00:30.07 --> 00:00:32.03
and the medal columns.

12
00:00:32.03 --> 00:00:34.02
What type is this object?

13
00:00:34.02 --> 00:00:37.09
In this next video, I will
work through these solutions

14
00:00:37.09 --> 00:00:41.04
so that you can see how I
would go about solving them.
