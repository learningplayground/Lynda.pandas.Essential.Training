1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.09
- [Instructor] String
handling generally have names

2
00:00:02.09 --> 00:00:06.08
matching the equivalent
scaler built in string methods

3
00:00:06.08 --> 00:00:08.08
that are available in Python.

4
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:13.02
These are available
under the str attribute.

5
00:00:13.02 --> 00:00:14.07
Using the str attribute,

6
00:00:14.07 --> 00:00:17.07
you have access to several
common string methods,

7
00:00:17.07 --> 00:00:22.09
such as contains, startswith,
isnumeric and so on.

8
00:00:22.09 --> 00:00:25.02
Let's head over to the Jupyter notebook

9
00:00:25.02 --> 00:00:28.02
to have a look at a couple of examples.

10
00:00:28.02 --> 00:00:30.06
Let's say we want to look
up the legendary Flo Jo,

11
00:00:30.06 --> 00:00:33.01
who is the fastest woman ever.

12
00:00:33.01 --> 00:00:36.08
Her time for the 100
meter sprint from 1988

13
00:00:36.08 --> 00:00:39.05
is still the fastest time recorded today.

14
00:00:39.05 --> 00:00:44.00
Now if you're like me, you
can't remember her full name.

15
00:00:44.00 --> 00:00:48.04
We know her name is Flo Jo,
so her first name is Florence.

16
00:00:48.04 --> 00:00:51.05
So I go to my data frame, Athlete,

17
00:00:51.05 --> 00:00:57.09
and I now use the new string
attribute str.contains,

18
00:00:57.09 --> 00:01:01.04
and I search for Florence.

19
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:03.02
If I want to see where this is true,

20
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:05.04
so I want to see the
rows where this is true,

21
00:01:05.04 --> 00:01:09.01
I enter this in square brackets,

22
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:10.05
and I can see a couple of Florences.

23
00:01:10.05 --> 00:01:12.09
So, Florence Syers and so on.

24
00:01:12.09 --> 00:01:15.07
Clearly the one that we're
looking for is Flo Jo

25
00:01:15.07 --> 00:01:19.06
from the USA who ran the 100
meters and 200 meters in 1988.

26
00:01:19.06 --> 00:01:23.09
So her full name is
Florence Griffith Joyner.

27
00:01:23.09 --> 00:01:26.05
That's the end of our basic analysis.

28
00:01:26.05 --> 00:01:27.04
In the next section,

29
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:29.07
we will look at a Jupyter notebook

30
00:01:29.07 --> 00:01:33.07
and look at some basic data
analysis worked examples.
