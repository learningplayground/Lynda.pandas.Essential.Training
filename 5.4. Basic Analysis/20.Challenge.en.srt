00:00:03.06 --> 00:00:04.08
- [Instructor] I've got
a couple of fun problems

2
00:00:04.08 --> 00:00:06.06
to work through.

3
00:00:06.06 --> 00:00:08.07
We're going to practice
using some of the tools

4
00:00:08.07 --> 00:00:10.00
that we've been learning

5
00:00:10.00 --> 00:00:14.03
such as head, value
counts and sort values.

6
00:00:14.03 --> 00:00:16.07
Why don't you have a go
at the questions first.

7
00:00:16.07 --> 00:00:17.05
Once you are done,

8
00:00:17.05 --> 00:00:19.01
I'll show you in the next video

9
00:00:19.01 --> 00:00:21.02
how I went about answering them

10
00:00:21.02 --> 00:00:23.02
but remember there's
often more than one way

11
00:00:23.02 --> 00:00:25.00
to do this in Pandas.

12
00:00:25.00 --> 00:00:27.01
These questions should
take you between five

13
00:00:27.01 --> 00:00:28.04
and 10 minutes,

14
00:00:28.04 --> 00:00:30.09
so let's have a quick
look at the questions.

15
00:00:30.09 --> 00:00:34.05
In which events did
Jesse Owens win a medal?

16
00:00:34.05 --> 00:00:37.06
Which country has won the
most men's gold medals

17
00:00:37.06 --> 00:00:40.02
in singles badminton over the years?

18
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:45.00
Sort the results alphabetically
by the players' names.

19
00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:48.01
Which three countries
have won the most medals

20
00:00:48.01 --> 00:00:49.08
in recent years,

21
00:00:49.08 --> 00:00:53.07
that's from 1984 to 2008?

22
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:57.04
And finally, display the
male gold medal winners

23
00:00:57.04 --> 00:01:00.01
of the 100-meters track
and field sprint event

24
00:01:00.01 --> 00:01:01.03
over the years.

25
00:01:01.03 --> 00:01:04.08
List the results starting
with the most recent first

26
00:01:04.08 --> 00:01:07.02
and show the Olympic city, edition,

27
00:01:07.02 --> 00:01:11.00
athlete and the country they represent.

28
00:01:11.00 --> 00:01:12.08
In the next video I'll show you

29
00:01:12.08 --> 00:01:15.05
how I went about
answering these questions.
