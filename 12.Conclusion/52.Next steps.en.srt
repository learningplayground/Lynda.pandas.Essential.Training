1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.00
- [Jonathan] Right, so
the spirit of the Olympics

2
00:00:02.00 --> 00:00:03.08
is all about finishing the race.

3
00:00:03.08 --> 00:00:04.06
So, well done.

4
00:00:04.06 --> 00:00:06.06
You've made it to the end of this course.

5
00:00:06.06 --> 00:00:08.01
Now one of my favorite quotes

6
00:00:08.01 --> 00:00:10.00
is from the Olympian Eric Liddell.

7
00:00:10.00 --> 00:00:12.01
He says, "I believe God
made me for a purpose,

8
00:00:12.01 --> 00:00:13.09
"but he also made me fast!

9
00:00:13.09 --> 00:00:16.05
"And when I run I feel his pleasure."

10
00:00:16.05 --> 00:00:18.05
So if data science is what excites you,

11
00:00:18.05 --> 00:00:20.09
then I hope I've helped you get better.

12
00:00:20.09 --> 00:00:24.03
You have now got several more
Pandas tools and resources

13
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:27.01
to turn to when analyzing
your next data set.

14
00:00:27.01 --> 00:00:28.02
So what next?

15
00:00:28.02 --> 00:00:30.03
Here are a couple of ideas.

16
00:00:30.03 --> 00:00:32.06
So you could use our Olympics data set

17
00:00:32.06 --> 00:00:34.03
to answer some of the following trivia

18
00:00:34.03 --> 00:00:37.01
Olympics questions listed here.

19
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:39.06
Alternatively, you can add data

20
00:00:39.06 --> 00:00:43.06
from the 2012 Olympics
onwards from other sources

21
00:00:43.06 --> 00:00:45.06
to the data set we've used and find out

22
00:00:45.06 --> 00:00:48.00
what new insights you can find.

23
00:00:48.00 --> 00:00:49.07
I hope you've enjoyed this course

24
00:00:49.07 --> 00:00:52.00
as much as I did putting it together.

25
00:00:52.00 --> 00:00:53.03
