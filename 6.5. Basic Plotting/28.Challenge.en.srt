00:00:03.05 --> 00:00:04.04
- [Instructor] So I'm really excited

2
00:00:04.04 --> 00:00:06.05
about chapter five's challenge.

3
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:09.07
These problems should only
take five to 10 minutes,

4
00:00:09.07 --> 00:00:12.06
and I've provided a
work solution for them.

5
00:00:12.06 --> 00:00:14.05
Now remember that they're
going to be multiple ways

6
00:00:14.05 --> 00:00:16.04
to solve these problems,

7
00:00:16.04 --> 00:00:18.07
and I've just provided my solution here.

8
00:00:18.07 --> 00:00:21.06
So let's get on to the
challenge questions.

9
00:00:21.06 --> 00:00:25.01
Plot the number of medals
achieved by the Chinese team,

10
00:00:25.01 --> 00:00:26.07
so that's both the men and women,

11
00:00:26.07 --> 00:00:32.01
in Beijing 2008 using
Matplotlib and Seaborn.

12
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:36.05
How can you use colormaps to
give the data more meaning?

13
00:00:36.05 --> 00:00:38.03
Plot the number of gold, silver,

14
00:00:38.03 --> 00:00:41.04
and bronze medals for each gender.

15
00:00:41.04 --> 00:00:44.03
And finally, how can you
give the data more meaning?

16
00:00:44.03 --> 00:00:46.01
Is there anything else you can change

17
00:00:46.01 --> 00:00:48.07
to make it more intuitive?

18
00:00:48.07 --> 00:00:50.01
I'll see you in the next video

19
00:00:50.01 --> 00:00:52.03
where I work through these examples.
