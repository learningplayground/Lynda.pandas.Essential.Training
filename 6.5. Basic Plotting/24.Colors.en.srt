- [Instructor] Plot colors.

2
00:00:02.05 --> 00:00:05.01
You have a couple of options
with regards to plot colors,

3
00:00:05.01 --> 00:00:07.09
and you need to just specify
the name of the color

4
00:00:07.09 --> 00:00:10.00
using the color parameter.

5
00:00:10.00 --> 00:00:11.05
In addition to this, you can include

6
00:00:11.05 --> 00:00:15.02
the type of plot that
you want and the color.

7
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:19.00
Matplotlib has several inbuilt colors,

8
00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:22.06
and they are available on
the Matplotlib website.

9
00:00:22.06 --> 00:00:24.03
Let's head over to the Jupyter Notebook

10
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:26.06
to look at an example.

11
00:00:26.06 --> 00:00:30.01
So using the same code as earlier,

12
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:35.09
I'm going to specify that
the color needs to be plum.

13
00:00:35.09 --> 00:00:39.01
And you can see that you
get the default line plot

14
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:41.02
in plum color.

15
00:00:41.02 --> 00:00:47.04
Alternatively, I could
specify that I want a

16
00:00:47.04 --> 00:00:50.00
bar graph,

17
00:00:50.00 --> 00:00:55.07
and I want it in maroon.

18
00:00:55.07 --> 00:00:59.01
In the next video, we will
look at how we can manipulate

19
00:00:59.01 --> 00:01:01.06
the figure size in Matplotlib.
