00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.03
- [Instructor] Colormaps are
included with Matplotlib.

2
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:05.06
The idea behind choosing a cool colormap,

3
00:00:05.06 --> 00:00:08.08
is to find a good
representation of your data.

4
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:11.07
It there an intuitive
color scheme for the data?

5
00:00:11.07 --> 00:00:15.02
For example gold, silver,
and bronze for medal winners.

6
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:17.05
Blue for male, pink for female?

7
00:00:17.05 --> 00:00:19.08
There are three classes of colormaps.

8
00:00:19.08 --> 00:00:26.00
The sequential, the diverging,
and the qualitative.

9
00:00:26.00 --> 00:00:28.06
The sequential should be used
for representing information

10
00:00:28.06 --> 00:00:30.01
that has ordering.

11
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:34.01
There is a change in lightness,
often over a single hue.

12
00:00:34.01 --> 00:00:37.08
Diverging is to be used when
the information being plotted

13
00:00:37.08 --> 00:00:39.05
deviates around a middle value.

14
00:00:39.05 --> 00:00:43.06
Here there are often two
different colors being used.

15
00:00:43.06 --> 00:00:46.07
And finally, the qualitative
class is used to represent

16
00:00:46.07 --> 00:00:48.09
information which does not have any

17
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:50.04
ordering or relationship,

18
00:00:50.04 --> 00:00:53.06
and is often miscellaneous colors.

19
00:00:53.06 --> 00:00:55.02
Let's head over to the Jupiter notebook

20
00:00:55.02 --> 00:00:58.05
to look at a couple of examples.

21
00:00:58.05 --> 00:01:01.05
Let's use the pie chart
as our first example,

22
00:01:01.05 --> 00:01:04.07
so we need to specify that
the kind of plot that you want

23
00:01:04.07 --> 00:01:07.01
is a pie chart,

24
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:10.06
and here we can specify that the colormap

25
00:01:10.06 --> 00:01:14.02
is Pastel1 for example.

26
00:01:14.02 --> 00:01:17.02
Notice that you would have
run into problems if you

27
00:01:17.02 --> 00:01:20.05
tried to plot a pie chart
using the color parameter,

28
00:01:20.05 --> 00:01:22.03
as this doesn't exist.

29
00:01:22.03 --> 00:01:25.06
In the next video, we
will look at Seaborn.

30
00:01:25.06 --> 00:01:29.03
Which provides very rich
and beautiful plots.
