00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.08
- [Instructor] The figure size is a toggle

2
00:00:02.08 --> 00:00:07.00
where you can specify the
width and the height in inches.

3
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:10.03
Let's head over to the Jupyter
Notebook for an example.

4
00:00:10.03 --> 00:00:12.00
So using the same one line of code

5
00:00:12.00 --> 00:00:14.08
that we've used in the past.

6
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:16.02
If I run that,

7
00:00:16.02 --> 00:00:17.08
you see that I have the problem

8
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:21.05
with the labels and the
X-axis overlapping each other.

9
00:00:21.05 --> 00:00:24.03
One solution to that is
to change the figure size.

10
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:27.09
So I could change that to a figure size of

11
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:32.09
10 by three inches.

12
00:00:32.09 --> 00:00:33.07
And you can see

13
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:36.05
this is a far better graph
than what we had earlier.

14
00:00:36.05 --> 00:00:40.03
In the next video, we
will look at color maps.
