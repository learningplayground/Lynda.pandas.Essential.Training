00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:03.01
- [Presenter] Seaborn Basic Plotting.

2
00:00:03.01 --> 00:00:08.02
Seaborn is a visualization
library based on Matplotlib.

3
00:00:08.02 --> 00:00:10.02
One of the reasons to use Seaborn

4
00:00:10.02 --> 00:00:13.08
is that it produces
beautiful statistical plots.

5
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:15.05
It is very important to realize

6
00:00:15.05 --> 00:00:17.05
that Seaborn is a complement

7
00:00:17.05 --> 00:00:21.00
and not a substitute to Matplotlib.

8
00:00:21.00 --> 00:00:23.01
Now one of the advantages
again with using Seaborn

9
00:00:23.01 --> 00:00:27.00
is that it works very well with pandas.

10
00:00:27.00 --> 00:00:30.03
Seaborn has an excellent examples gallery

11
00:00:30.03 --> 00:00:33.02
that provides plots on the website,

12
00:00:33.02 --> 00:00:34.06
and if you click on any of the plots,

13
00:00:34.06 --> 00:00:38.03
it provides the code
to generate that plot.

14
00:00:38.03 --> 00:00:40.05
Seaborn, as with Matplotlib,

15
00:00:40.05 --> 00:00:44.07
has methods for bar plots,
histograms and pie charts.

16
00:00:44.07 --> 00:00:46.05
Let's take a look at an example

17
00:00:46.05 --> 00:00:49.00
of one of the methods, countplot.

18
00:00:49.00 --> 00:00:53.05
Countplot has very similar
parameters to Matplotlib.

19
00:00:53.05 --> 00:00:57.01
The data parameter for
countplot is where you provide

20
00:00:57.01 --> 00:01:00.03
the DataFrame or the source for the data.

21
00:01:00.03 --> 00:01:03.03
The hue is for the categorical variables.

22
00:01:03.03 --> 00:01:04.09
A categorical variable

23
00:01:04.09 --> 00:01:08.06
is one that can only take
a fixed number of values.

24
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:09.09
In the Olympics dataset,

25
00:01:09.09 --> 00:01:13.03
we have a couple of examples
of categorical variables.

26
00:01:13.03 --> 00:01:15.06
There are only a limited number of sports,

27
00:01:15.06 --> 00:01:17.07
the gender is either male or female,

28
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:21.03
and medals are gold, silver or bronze.

29
00:01:21.03 --> 00:01:24.06
The hue allows you to specify
a categorical variable

30
00:01:24.06 --> 00:01:27.00
in a different color.

31
00:01:27.00 --> 00:01:29.02
The order parameter
allows you to determine

32
00:01:29.02 --> 00:01:32.07
the sequence of the categorical variables.

33
00:01:32.07 --> 00:01:35.03
And finally, the palette parameter

34
00:01:35.03 --> 00:01:36.09
allows you to specify colors

35
00:01:36.09 --> 00:01:40.02
for the different levels
of the hue variable.

36
00:01:40.02 --> 00:01:43.09
So when would you use
Seaborn versus Matplotlib?

37
00:01:43.09 --> 00:01:45.08
If you're running a couple of scripts,

38
00:01:45.08 --> 00:01:48.05
then Matplotlib with pyplot is easy to use

39
00:01:48.05 --> 00:01:52.02
and great for bar charts,
pie charts and so on.

40
00:01:52.02 --> 00:01:53.07
If you're looking to write short scripts

41
00:01:53.07 --> 00:01:56.04
to deal with things like categorical data,

42
00:01:56.04 --> 00:01:58.08
or more advanced statistical plots,

43
00:01:58.08 --> 00:02:02.00
or creating other kinds
of plots such as heatmaps,

44
00:02:02.00 --> 00:02:05.00
then Seaborn is going to be your choice.

45
00:02:05.00 --> 00:02:09.06
Let's head over to the Jupyter
Notebook for an example.

46
00:02:09.06 --> 00:02:13.07
Now because we have
already imported Matplotlib

47
00:02:13.07 --> 00:02:16.06
and the pandas library
and the dataset earlier,

48
00:02:16.06 --> 00:02:20.06
we don't need to do that again.

49
00:02:20.06 --> 00:02:23.09
What we do need to do is to
import the Seaborn library.

50
00:02:23.09 --> 00:02:30.02
So import Seaborn as sns and run that.

51
00:02:30.02 --> 00:02:31.08
Now let's understand a little bit more

52
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:34.07
about the countplot method.

53
00:02:34.07 --> 00:02:37.07
How many medals have
been won by men and women

54
00:02:37.07 --> 00:02:40.00
in the history of the Olympics?

55
00:02:40.00 --> 00:02:45.00
Well, using the sns library,

56
00:02:45.00 --> 00:02:49.09
we know that we're trying to
determine the number of medals,

57
00:02:49.09 --> 00:02:55.05
our data source is our DataFrame oo,

58
00:02:55.05 --> 00:02:57.05
and we can see here that
the number of medals won

59
00:02:57.05 --> 00:02:59.07
by men and women in the
history of the Olympics

60
00:02:59.07 --> 00:03:02.07
is presented in this plot.

61
00:03:02.07 --> 00:03:04.04
Now if we wanted to know the number of

62
00:03:04.04 --> 00:03:08.05
gold, silver and bronze
medals won for each gender,

63
00:03:08.05 --> 00:03:11.03
this is where we can use
the categorical variable.

64
00:03:11.03 --> 00:03:16.05
And all we need to do here
is to add hue equals gender

65
00:03:16.05 --> 00:03:19.02
and that will allow us to present

66
00:03:19.02 --> 00:03:22.06
the distribution of gold,
silver and bronze medals

67
00:03:22.06 --> 00:03:26.00
amongst the men and the women.

68
00:03:26.00 --> 00:03:29.02
In the next video, we will
look at a plotting challenge.
